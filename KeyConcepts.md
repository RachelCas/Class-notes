## Key concepts. 
**Block chain.** Mutable, distributed/ ledges & Network.

**Proof of work.** How many attempts are needed to find the hash (specific message + secret key) = public key with defined characterictics, "nonce". 

**Zero Knowledge proof.** One side proves to the others that what they know is true, without sharing any details. Make the blockchain trusted. 

**Cryptography.** Coding practice to prevent any kind of file to be readable. 

**Hash.** A certain combination of characters that refer to a message created with a secret or personal key. The message can be of any kind and size, the hash will remain with a combination of 2E256.
